Plan:

The structure of the Tic Tac Toe Game would consist of three main files: index.html, main.js, and styles.css.

1. index.html: This file will contain the HTML structure of the game. It will contain a game board which will be a 3x3 grid. Each cell of the grid will have a unique id for identifying it in the JavaScript file. The ids will be in a 'cell-xy' format, where x and y are the coordinates of the cell in the grid. There will also be a reset button with the id 'reset-button' to restart the game. A message div with the id 'message' will be used to display messages to the user.

2. main.js: This file will contain the JavaScript logic for the game. It will contain the following variables and functions:
    - Variables:
        - `board`: a 2D array representing the game board.
        - `currentPlayer`: a variable storing the current player ('X' or 'O').
    - Functions:
        - `init()`: initializes the game board and sets the current player.
        - `handleClick(event)`: handles the click event on a cell of the game board.
        - `checkWin()`: check if the current player has won.
        - `resetGame()`: resets the game board and the current player.

3. styles.css: This file will contain the CSS styling for the game. It will style the game board, cells, and the reset button. It will also style the message div to make it visually appealing.

By structuring the application in this way, we can ensure that the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code are cleanly separated, making it easier to maintain and modify the code. It also ensures that the user interface is intuitive and the game rules are correctly implemented.
